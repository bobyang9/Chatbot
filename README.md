# Chatbot

A chatbot that I made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Features:

  - Automatically scroll to the most recent message
  - Responsive layout through using flexbox
  - Emoticon buttons for quick addition to chat
  - Decision tree (top-down AI) to respond to likely messages
  - Aesthetic CSS styling
